# OpenAI Codex Integration Toolkit

This skill provides comprehensive guidance and tools for working with OpenAI Codex, the AI code generation system. Use this skill when users need assistance with Codex integration, prompt engineering, code generation workflows, or building applications that leverage Codex's capabilities.

## Overview

OpenAI Codex is a powerful AI system that can understand and generate code in multiple programming languages. This skill provides specialized knowledge and workflows for:

- Code generation and completion
- Prompt engineering for optimal results
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Debugging and optimization techniques
- Building applications with Codex

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Code Generation

When users request code generation:

1. **Analyze the requirements** - Understand the specific functionality needed
2. **Choose appropriate language** - Select the best programming language for the task
3. **Craft effective prompts** - Use clear, specific instructions with examples
4. **Provide context** - Include relevant background information and constraints
5. **Validate output** - Review generated code for correctness and best practices

### 2. Prompt Engineering

For optimal Codex performance:

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific and detailed in your requests
- Provide clear examples of input/output
- Include relevant context and constraints
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps

**Prompt Templates:**
```
# Function Generation
"Write a [language] function that [specific task]. 
Input: [example input]
Output: [expected output]
Requirements: [constraints]"

# Class Generation
"Create a [language] class for [purpose] with the following methods:
- [method1]: [description]
- [method2]: [description]
Include proper error handling and documentation."

# Algorithm Implementation
"Implement [algorithm name] in [language] with:
- Time complexity: O([complexity])
- Space complexity: O([complexity])
- Handle edge cases: [specific cases]"
```

### 3. Integration Patterns

**API Integration:**
```python
import openai

def generate_code(prompt, language="python", max_tokens=1000):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="code-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        temperature=0.1,
        stop=["\n\n\n"]
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

**Streaming Integration:**
```python
def stream_code_generation(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="code-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0.1,
        stream=True
    )
    
    for chunk in response:
        if chunk.choices[0].text:
            yield chunk.choices[0].text
```

### 4. Code Optimization

When optimizing Codex-generated code:

1. **Review for efficiency** - Check time and space complexity
2. **Validate logic** - Ensure the code works as intended
3. **Add error handling** - Include proper exception handling
4. **Improve readability** - Add comments and clear variable names
5. **Test thoroughly** - Verify with various test cases

### 5. Debugging Techniques

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

- **Incomplete code**: Add more specific instructions or examples
- **Wrong language**: Specify the exact language and version
- **Logic errors**: Provide more detailed requirements and edge cases
- **Formatting issues**: Use consistent indentation and style guidelines

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate a Python Function
```
User: "Create a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
Response: Use the function generation template with specific requirements
```

### Example 2: Build a REST API
```
User: "Build a REST API for user management"
Response: Generate complete API structure with proper error handling
```

### Example 3: Optimize Existing Code
```
User: "Optimize this code for better performance"
Response: Analyze and improve the provided code
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Language Support
- Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, and more
- Language-specific best practices and patterns
- Cross-language compatibility considerations

### 2. Code Review and Analysis
- Automated code quality checks

- Integration test creation
- Test case optimization
- Mock data generation

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Design
- Start with clear, specific instructions
- Provide examples and context
- Use consistent formatting
- Include error handling requirements

### 2. Code Quality
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Include proper documentation
- Implement error handling
- Write testable code

### 3. Performance

- Minimize resource usage

### 4. Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use secure coding practices
- Implement proper authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Code doesn't work**: Check syntax and logic
2. **Incomplete output**: Increase max_tokens or improve prompt
3. **Wrong language**: Specify exact language and version
4. **Poor quality**: Provide more specific requirements

### Debugging Steps
1. Review the generated code carefully
2. Test with various inputs
3. Check for syntax errors
4. Validate logic flow
5. Optimize as needed
