# Software Testing Methodologies

Testing is a critical phase in software development that ensures code quality, functionality, and reliability before deployment.

## Testing Types

Various testing types serve different purposes throughout the development lifecycle, from unit tests to end-to-end integration tests.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. They should be fast, independent, and cover edge cases. Mocking dependencies ensures isolation.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. They ensure interfaces between modules function as expected.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios across the entire application. They validate complete workflows and user interactions.

## Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests before implementation code. This approach leads to better design and higher test coverage.

## Continuous Testing

In CI/CD pipelines, automated tests run on every code change, providing rapid feedback. This helps catch issues early and maintains code quality.
