# Container Orchestration

Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes manage containerized applications at scale.

## Pods and Services

Pods are the smallest deployable units. Services provide stable network endpoints for pod access. Load balancing distributes traffic across instances.

## Deployments

Deployments manage replica sets and enable rolling updates. They ensure desired state matches actual state through reconciliation loops.

## Scaling

Horizontal scaling adds more pod instances. Vertical scaling increases resource allocation. Auto-scaling adjusts based on metrics automatically.
