# Web Development Best Practices

Modern web development requires understanding multiple technologies and following best practices to create maintainable, scalable applications.

## Frontend Development

Frontend development involves creating the user interface and experience. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation, with modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular providing powerful abstractions.

### Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures applications work well across different screen sizes and devices. Using flexible layouts, media queries, and mobile-first approaches is essential.

### Performance Optimization

Performance is critical for user experience. Techniques include code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and minimizing JavaScript bundle sizes.

## Backend Development

Backend development handles server-side logic, databases, and API design. Common languages include Python, Node.js, Java, and Go.

### API Design

RESTful APIs follow standard conventions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. GraphQL provides an alternative approach with flexible querying capabilities.

### Database Management

Choosing the right database (SQL vs NoSQL) depends on data structure, scalability needs, and consistency requirements. Understanding normalization and indexing is crucial.
