# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, enabling on-demand access to resources without managing physical infrastructure.

## Service Models

Cloud computing offers three primary service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

### Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage operating systems, applications, and data while the provider handles hardware and networking.

### Platform as a Service

PaaS offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure. Developers focus on code while the platform handles scaling and maintenance.

### Software as a Service

SaaS delivers complete applications over the internet. Users access software through web browsers without installing or maintaining anything locally.

## Deployment Strategies

Cloud platforms support various deployment strategies including blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates to minimize downtime during updates.

## Security Considerations

Cloud security involves shared responsibility models, encryption, access controls, and compliance with regulations. Understanding these aspects is essential for secure cloud adoption.
