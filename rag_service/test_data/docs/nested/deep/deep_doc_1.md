# API Documentation

RESTful APIs follow standard HTTP methods. GET retrieves data, POST creates resources, PUT updates existing resources, and DELETE removes resources.

## Authentication

API authentication typically uses tokens or API keys. OAuth 2.0 provides a secure authorization framework for third-party access.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting prevents abuse by restricting the number of requests per time period. This protects servers and ensures fair resource usage.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling returns meaningful status codes and error messages. Common status codes include 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized, and 500 for server errors.
