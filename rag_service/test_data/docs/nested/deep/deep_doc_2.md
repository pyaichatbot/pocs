# Version Control with Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and enables collaboration across teams.

## Basic Commands

`git init` creates a new repository. `git add` stages changes. `git commit` saves changes with a message. `git push` uploads to remote repositories.

## Branching Strategy

Branching allows parallel development. Feature branches isolate new work. Main branch maintains production-ready code. Merge requests facilitate code review.

## Collaboration

Git enables multiple developers to work simultaneously. Pull requests provide mechanisms for reviewing and discussing changes before merging.
