# Database Management Systems

Databases are fundamental to storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently. Understanding different database types and their characteristics is crucial for system design.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases organize data into tables with relationships defined by foreign keys. ACID properties ensure data consistency and reliability.

### SQL Fundamentals

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. Understanding SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN operations is essential.

### Normalization

Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity. The process involves organizing data to minimize duplication and ensure dependencies are properly handled.

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases provide alternatives to relational models, offering flexibility for unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Document Databases

Document databases store data in flexible document formats, typically JSON. They excel at handling hierarchical data and are popular for content management systems.

### Key-Value Stores

Key-value stores provide simple data models with fast read/write operations. They're ideal for caching, session management, and real-time applications.

## Performance Optimization

Database performance depends on proper indexing, query optimization, connection pooling, and caching strategies. Monitoring and profiling help identify bottlenecks.
