Version 1.106 of @code is rolling out with a bunch of new features I’ve been writing about over the past month and a half - and most importantly, everything that was showcased at @githubuniverse 🚀

Let’s start with the most exciting ones:
📌 Agent Sessions view is now enabled by default - you can see and start agents of all kinds: local, cloud, Codex, Claude Code, and even Copilot CLI.
📌 The new Plan Mode agent is now available to everyone - and it’s not just another agent mode. It leverages all the goodies under the hood - sub-agents and handoffs - enabling smarter context management and true workflow creation.
📌 Speaking of the Agent Session view - it’s worth saying it clearly: VS Code now has built-in cloud agents from multiple providers.
📌 Chat Mode has been refreshed and is now called Custom Agent - it includes schemas supporting both local and cloud execution.
📌 You can now attach terminal commands directly to the chat.
📌 A new terminal command parser brings major improvements in how agents interact with the terminal.
📌 Enhanced tool authorization schema from servers or extensions - if you trust the source, you can now auto-approve all its tools.
📌 You can now view terminal execution directly within the chat window.
📌 Use /savePrompt to easily save a chat as a prompt - it uses an LLM to effectively summarize the conversation into a reusable prompt.
📌 Tons of UI/UX improvements to enhance the chat experience.
📌 You can now install MCPs directly to a workspace, not just to the user level.
📌 Added CIMD authentication support in addition to DCR for MCPs.

And much more.
Can’t wait to start spreading it in my company
