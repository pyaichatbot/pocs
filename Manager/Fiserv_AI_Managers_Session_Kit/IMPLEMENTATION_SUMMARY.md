## 🔄 Redundancy Removal Summary

### Major Redundancies Removed

1. **Anthropic Deep Dive (10b)**

   - **Kept:** Brief reference pointing to incident slides (slide 10)
   - **Result:** No duplication between slide 10 and file 10b

2. **Governance Actions**
   - **Status:** Kept in multiple places but with clear separation:
     - Slide 9: High-level governance actions (for presentation)
     - File 10: Brief governance overview
     - File 10b: Detailed mitigation strategies (implementation focus)
   - **Result:** Different levels of detail for different audiences

3. **Security Controls**
   - **Status:** Kept in multiple places with clear purpose:
     - Slide 9: High-level security pillars (for presentation)
     - File 10b: Detailed implementation (for execution)
   - **Result:** Manager view vs. implementation detail

### Minor Redundancies (Acceptable)

- **HITL Mentions:** Kept in 3 places (file 08, slide 9, file 10b) - acceptable as they serve different purposes
- **MCP Security:** Kept in 3 places (file 04, slide 9, file 10b) - acceptable with clear narrative flow
