# Executive Speaker Notes — AI Agents Presentation
## For Fiserv EMEA IT Managers (50-Minute Session)

**Purpose:** Concise speaking cues, not full scripts. Use as reference during presentation.

**Format:** Key message → Talking points → Timing cues → Audience prompts

---

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide (1 minute)

**Key Message:** Set expectations — threat, opportunity, decisions

**Talking Points:**
- "Today: How AI becomes an enterprise lever—securely, compliantly, measurably."
- "By the end: You'll understand the threat, see the opportunity, and know what decisions we need."
- "This is about actionable outcomes, not theory."

**Timing:** [KEEP IT SHORT] 1 minute max

**Transition:** "Let me start with why this matters right now."

---

## SLIDE 2: The AI Shift in Financial Services (3 minutes)

**Key Message:** Competitive pressure is real, delay costs market share

**Talking Points:**
- [EMPHASIZE] "This isn't theoretical. Competitors are moving now."
  - Stripe: AI fraud detection
  - Revolut: Automated compliance

- [SLOW DOWN] "5-15% market share loss over 2 years. 10-20% customer churn increase."
- [EMPHASIZE] "€2M-€5M opportunity cost per 6-month delay."

**Timing:** [PAUSE after each competitor] Let it sink in

**Audience Prompt:** [ASK QUESTION] "Which of these competitors concerns you most?"

**Transition:** "But there's a bigger threat. Let me show you what happened in September 2025."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Threat — AI-Orchestrated Cyber Espionage (4 minutes)

**Key Message:** Real-world threat — AI is now an active attacker

**Talking Points:**
- [SLOW DOWN] "This happened in September 2025. This is real."
- [EMPHASIZE] "30+ organizations targeted. Financial institutions included."
- [PAUSE] "80-90% AI-autonomous. That means AI made decisions, executed actions, adapted in real-time."
- [EMPHASIZE] "Thousands of requests per second. Impossible for humans to match."
- [SLOW DOWN] "This is why governance is not optional. This is why we need to act now."

**Timing:** [LONG PAUSE after "80-90% AI-autonomous"] Let the gravity sink in

**Audience Prompt:** [MAKE EYE CONTACT] "This is the new reality. We must defend with AI."

**Transition:** "Which brings me to regulatory risk. The penalties are severe."

---

## SLIDE 4: Regulatory Risk (3 minutes)

**Timing:** [PAUSE after each penalty amount]

**Audience Prompt:** [ADDRESS CONCERN] "I know you're thinking about cost. But compare €30K-€60K for governance to €1M-€10M in fines."

**Transition:** "Now let me show you the opportunity. What AI Agents actually deliver."

---

## SLIDE 5: What Are AI Agents? (3 minutes)

**Key Message:** Agents take actions, chatbots don't

## Common Objections & Responses

**"We don't have budget."**  
→ "€50K-€100K for pilots is small compared to €2M-€5M cost of delay. Start with one use case."

**"This is too risky."**  
→ "We start with low-risk, read-only pilots. Governance and security built-in. Rollback procedures ready."

**"We need more time to think."**  
→ "I understand. But every week costs market share. Can we commit to working group formation this week, pilot decision next week?"

**"What if competitors are already ahead?"**  
→ "The window is still open. We're building on enterprise-grade foundation. We can catch up and potentially leapfrog."

**"How do we know this will work?"**  
→ "Proven use cases, clear success metrics, phased approach. Start small, measure, scale. This is how successful AI adoption works."
